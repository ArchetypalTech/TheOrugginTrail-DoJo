# Eli's Barn

the barn is old and smells of old hay and oddly dissolution

the floor is dirt and trampled dried horse shit scattered with straw and broken bottles

the smell is not unpleasent and reminds you faintly of petrol and old socks

```yaml
roomType: "forge"
```

## a dusty window, at chest height

```yaml
direction: East
type: "window"
material: "glass"
```

### actions

#### [the window, closes with a creak](elis-barn.md)

```yaml
enabled: true
```

#### the window, smashes, glass flies everywhere, very very satisfying

```yaml
type: "break"
enabled: false
```
